<!-- There are several loops in javascript,where it does not throw error for example -->

- null \* 212 = 0 [No Error]
- undefined \* 3434 = NaN [No Error]
- const shape = {
  width : 14,height : 12
  }

<!-- if I try to access other keys of shap object, then it will provide undefined value, but it should throw error.
 -->
